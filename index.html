    <h2>My Invention – GlyphCode</h2>
    <p>
      I invented a writing style called <b>GlyphCode</b>.
      It is a self-created symbolic writing system for the English language.
      Letters and words are represented using unique symbols such as @, |, ₹, ¶, and ∆.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, GlyphCode may look confusing, but once learned, it becomes interesting and fun.
